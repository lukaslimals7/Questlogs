**This is a minimal retro habit tracker with some gamification that I that lives in URL !**

Your habits, but make it an 8-bit RPG. Let’s be honest: building habits is hard. Missing a day of journaling or skipping the gym usually just results in vague guilt. So, why not turn that guilt into literal in-game damage?

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack HTML5, Tailwindcss & Vanilla JavaScript

Keeping it simple and lightweight.

TailwindCSS: For the responsive grid layout (heavily customized with raw CSS for the 8-bit aesthetic).
LZ-String: The secret sauce that compresses the JSON save data into a tiny URL string.

⚠️ A Note on Permadeath If your HP hits 0, you die. Your avatar becomes a skull ☠️. You can buy potions to stay alive, but if you ignore your habits for too long, your hero falls.
Don't give up, Hero.
Feel free to fork this, mod it, break it, or make it harder. The code is yours.
